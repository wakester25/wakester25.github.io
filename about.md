Go by the name Wakester! Network Engineer turned Cyber Security analyst that seems to be interested in everything tech. Using this space as a scratchpad for my thoughts, ideas and to showcase some of my work. 

### More Information

A little background on me. Graduated from university back in 2019 with a degree in Network Engineering. Had full intentions of breaking into the network automation space but somehow fell into a Cyber Security role, which has since become my new-found passion!
I am currently focusing a lot of my learning on malware analysis and blue team tactics, but I occasionally dabble in CTFs / Red Team topics. I am starting this blog to supplement my learning and just act as a place to post about cool technology topics. 

Hope you enjoy the content!
